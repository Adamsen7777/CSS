   <h1> KID'S POEM </h1>
    <p>Although Shel Silverstein (1930-1999) wrote poetry for young children, adults can glean many lessons from his pieces. 
        This poem is filled with lessons on dreaming and persevering.
         Donâ€™t allow others to get you down, because in the end, anything is possible.</p>

         <p>Shel Silverstein's (1930-1999) comedic genius is demonstrated in this short, funny poem that is sure to bring
             a smile to children of all ages and adults as well.
        </p>

        <p>I am only a kid. I really like to write poems, and I thought I'd make a nice little poem about nature for our 
            school magazine.It's one of my best poems. Thanks for reading this poem!</p>
