    <p>The Porsche 911 is the most iconic name in the supercar segment, all around the world. With decades of heritage in motorsports,
        the Porsche 911 is an extremely capable rear-engine rear-wheel-drive car. The iconic design and the flat-six engine layout of
        the Porsche 911 are retained to this date. The Porsche 911 supercars come either 
        with a 3.8-litre twin-turbo flat-six (Turbo and GT2 models) or a 4.0-litre naturally-aspirated flat-six engine 
       <span>  (GT3 and GT3RS models)  </span>. The engines come mated to Porscheâ€™s reputed PDK automatic gearbox or a manual.</p>
